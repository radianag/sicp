;From book, this is for set-of-records as list
(define (lookup given-key set-of-records)
  (cond ((null? set-of-records) false)
        ((equal? given-key 
                 (key (car set-of-records)))
         (car set-of-records))
        (else 
         (lookup given-key 
                 (cdr set-of-records)))))

;Answer, this is for set-of-records as tree
(define (lookup given-key set-of-records)
  (cond ((null? set-of-records)
         #f)
        ((= given-key (key (entry set-of-records)))
         (entry set-of-records))
        ((< given-key (key (entry set-of-records)))
         (lookup given-key (left-branch set-of-records)))
        ((> given-key (key (entry set-of-records)))
         (lookup given-key (right-branch set-of-records)))))
